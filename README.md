## Consumer

Example usage:

```
NSQLookup lookup = new DefaultNSQLookup();
lookup.addLookupAddress("localhost", 4161);
NSQConsumer consumer = new NSQConsumer(lookup, "speedtest", "dustin", (message) -> {
        System.out.println("received: " + message);            
        //now mark the message as finished.
        message.finished();
        
        //or you could requeue it, which indicates a failure and puts it back on the queue.
        //message.requeue();
});
        
consumer.start();
```

## Producer

Example usage: 

```
NSQProducer producer = new NSQProducer().addAddress("localhost", 4150).start();            
producer.produce("TestTopic", ("this is a message").getBytes());
```

## Backoff

By default Backoff does not kick in and a consumer will eat all your memory
and CPU. To enable Backoff you have to set your own thread pool executer with:

```
consumer.setExecutor(...);
```
